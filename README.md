## XMLCC

### C++ library for generating, reading, and writing XML

**The continuous integration** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graetz23/xmlcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graetz23/xmlcc) **on travis-ci.com**

### Introduction

XMLCC is an object-oriented C++ library for parsing, modifying, creating, and writing  the extensible markup language (XML) by implementing a kind of SAX interface and some kind of DOM tree. It is strongly object-oriented and based on [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) for generating, searching, and parsing even *badly malformed* XML files.

Two parsers are available: a simple API for XML (SAX) parser for an event based parsing and a document object model (DOM) parser generating an object model tree.

The library provides an easy access to XML files.

### Remarks

This library is - yet - a non validating, not - really - speed optimized for very large files, and explicit not dealing with file encodings.

For normal sized XMLs - arond 10 Mega Byte - xmlCC does a very fine job. However, if XML files get larger, there should be a different strategy for parsing. Currently xmlCC read char by char which allows for throwing an exception exactely at line and char number.

File encondings are overcome by C++'s local standard template libraries (STL). Futhermore xmlCC is written in ANSI / C++, so it has a true platform independency.

### How To

Just clone the repository and build it for some *unix or GNU/Linux* machines by:

**git clone https://github.com/graetz23/xmlcc.git && cd xmlcc && make**

Some **example using xmlcc** for **generating** simple **HTML**:

```C++
DOM::Root* xml = 0; // null pointer
xml = new DOM::Root( "xmlcc.html", new DOM::Doctype( ), // used for file name
  new DOM::Comment( "XMLCC 1.01 20200307 Amara Faith" ),
  new DOM::Element( "html",
    new DOM::Element( "head",
      new DOM::Element( "title",
        new DOM::Value( "HTML generated by XMLCC" ) ) ),
    new DOM::Element( "body" ),
    new DOM::Element( "center",
      new DOM::Comment( "HTML was generated by XMLCC" ),
      new DOM::Value( "Hello" ),
      new DOM::Element( "b", new DOM::Value( "WWW" ) ),
      new DOM::Value( "from XMLCC" ), new DOM::Element( "br" ),
      new DOM::Element( "a",
        new DOM::Attribute( "href",
          "https://github.com/graetz23/xmlcc/" ),
        new DOM::Value( "visit project page" )
      )
    )
  )
); // some composite with multiple decorators
```

Now **writing** the xml **to file**

```C++
std::cout << "writing DOM tree to file .. " << std::flush;
std::fstream file; // open file
file.open( ( (char*)( xml->getStr( ).c_str( ) ) ), std::ios::out ); // some name
file << xml; // overloaded operator; the DOM tree goes std::ostream
file.close( );
```
The written file [looks like this](https://github.com/graetz23/xmlcc/tree/master/XMLCC/xmlcc.html)!

Deleting all generated objects of the DOM tree:

```C++
delete xml; // deletes recursively the complete DOM tree
```

and parsing an XML file to XMLCC's DOM tree:

```C++
XMLCC::DOM::Core core; // keeping methods for parsing 2 DOM tree
XMLCC::DOM::Root* root = core.parseFile2DomTree( fileName ); // root of DOM tree
if( root != 0 ) {
  std::cout << root << std::flush << std::endl; // DOM tree 2 std::ostream
  delete root; // deletes complete DOM tree
} // if root
delete root; // delete tree again
```

**.. have fun!**
